#### For detailed and complete write ups, see the Write Ups.


This was a project Mei Maddox and William Pembleton worked on in Fall 2019, inspired by a Minecraft mod called Dimensional Doors. In the game, we built a few different levels each exploring an interesting idea. 

Our game was built in Unreal 4.23 for the Oculus Rift. Although untested, we belive it is also compatible for play on the HTC Vive but we haven't tested it. This project was built on Windows, therefore we are unsure if the binaries would need to be recompiled if run on a different operating system.

# How to play 
If you want to play the game go up to the top right and click on release, download DimensionalDoors.zip, then click on DimensionalDoors.exe. Hope you like it :smile:

# Controls 
To open a door you close your hand and reach for the door knob

Left hand joystick controls movement (walking is relative to the player, not the world)

A increase speed (Upper right hand button)

B decrease speed (Lower right hand button)

Side triggers close your hand

# Levels

### Spawn Map 
This level allows players to be in a room where they can just play around with the controls and get comfortable in VR.
### Cave 
Within this level the player is taken to a cave system and is required to navigate across a bridge above bubbling slime, avoiding any holes/missing boards. Should the player accidentally fall through a gap in the bridge or off it entirely, they would hit the slime and trigger their death - respawn at the beginning of the level. 

### Kitchen
If you’ve seen the old Alice in Wonderland movie Disney released in 1951 then you might recognize we’re recreating the [Door Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di7dZwidXZU). In the scene Alice sees a door that's too small for her to fit through. She then drinks a bottle and shrinks down to a size that's small enough to walk through the door. We recreated that scene in VR where you drink from a bottle and shrink down.
### Nothingness
In this level we wanted to see if players would get motion sick if they were walking on nothing (thus the name). By the way for this level you can't move with the joystick past the platform, you need to physically walk to the door. If your VR playspace is too small to reach the door either move the door closer or just restart the game so that you can hopefully skip this level
### Ocean
This level simulates life at the bottom of the sea. Surrounded by schools of fish, rocks, coral, seaweed, and a sunken submarine, the player wanders along the seafloor in search of the door. Beware of the giant eel and shark!
